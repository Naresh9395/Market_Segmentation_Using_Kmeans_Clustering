# Market_Segmentation_Using_Kmeans_Clustering
In this project i have used K-Means Clustering model for segmentation of data for the credit card holder of a bank.
I have done EDA part to visualize the data
I have found some missing values in the data set so i have done some missing values treatment.
I find out 8 clusters are enough for the data segmentation by using elbow method
Feature scalling (standardization) also done for the data set
In the final i have done principle component analysis to find important features.
